# Project-Library

📚 Ultimate Book LibraryOverviewThe Ultimate Book Library is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. It serves as a personal catalog for tracking books, demonstrating core concepts of Object-Oriented JavaScript (OOJS) using constructors and prototypes, and advanced DOM manipulation.This project fulfills the requirements of The Odin Project's Library assignment, focusing on creating and managing individual data objects (books) and synchronizing that data with the user interface.Key FeaturesDynamic Card Creation: Books added via the form are immediately rendered on the page as individual, responsive cards.Object-Oriented Data Model: Uses a Book constructor and prototype methods to define and manage book objects in a central myLibrary array.Status Toggling (Prototype Functionality): Each card features a "Change Status" button that executes a Book.prototype.changeStatus method. This demonstrates:Correctly binding the function's this context to the specific book instance using .bind(this).Synchronizing the book's internal data (this.status) and the external HTML display.Persistent Card Management: Each book and its associated buttons (Delete, Change Status) are uniquely linked via a uuid (Universally Unique Identifier).Deletion Functionality: Users can remove a book card from the DOM and permanently delete the corresponding object from the myLibrary array using its uuid.Modal Form: Uses the native HTML <dialog> element for a clean, accessible book entry form.Technologies UsedCategoryTechnologyPurposeStructureHTML5Provides the basic layout and the <dialog> modal.LogicJavaScript (ES6+)Handles the data model (Constructors/Prototypes), DOM manipulation, and event listeners.StylingCSS3(Implied) For making the library cards and layout presentable.Core ConceptFunction.prototype.bind()Essential for correctly scoping prototype functions to object instances in event handlers.Data StructureThe main data is managed by the following two components:1. The Book ConstructorJavaScriptfunction Book(title, author, pages, status) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.pages = pages;
    this.status = status; // 'Read' or 'Unread'
    this.uuid = crypto.randomUUID(); // Unique ID for management
}
2. Prototype FunctionThe changeStatus function is defined once on the prototype but is used by all book objects. It accepts the status HTML element as an argument to update the UI after changing the internal object state.JavaScriptBook.prototype.changeStatus = function(statusElement) {
    // Logic for toggling this.status and updating statusElement.textContent
};
How to Run LocallyClone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your Repository URL Here]
Navigate to the Directory:Bashcd ultimate-book-library
Open in Browser:Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.Areas for Future ImprovementLocal Storage: Implement localStorage to persist the myLibrary array across browser sessions.Input Validation: Add error handling and validation for form inputs (e.g., ensuring title/author are not empty).Refactoring to ES6 Classes: Convert the constructor/prototype pattern to modern ES6 class syntax for better readability.Built by: [Ofosu Newton/GitHub Handle] | Project for: The Odin Project (Full Stack JavaScript Path)
